Getting and Cleaning data Course Project docs &amp; Script

In the script 'run_analysis.r' you may find my work for the Getting and Cleaning data Course Project.

This script runs with local data in my computer but it can be downloaded here:https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The script extracts the mean and standard variation components of a raw set of accelerometer data. The data compiles data from 6 activities (walking, walking downstairs, walking upstairs, standing, laying) for 30 individuals. 

The final data set obtained by running the script summarizes the extracted variables by averaging them by activity type and by subject, that is, 6*30=180 observations.
